# This is an all time favorite Pizza - Must try! 
Classic Hawaiian Pizza combines pizza sauce, cheese, cooked ham, and pineapple. This crowd-pleasing pizza recipe starts with my homemade pizza crust and is finished with a sprinkle of crispy bacon. It’s salty, sweet, cheesy, and undeniably delicious!

Hawaiian pizza is the most underrated pizza on the planet. Combining pineapple, cheese, and ham, Hawaiian pizza is sweet, salty, and cheesy all in 1 bite. It’s just the BEST pizza variety! We’re using my homemade pizza crust and adding bacon on top. Bacon isn’t a traditional Hawaiian pizza topping, but everything goes with bacon… right?

Homemade Pizza Dough
Let’s talk homemade pizza crust. I’ve been making this pizza dough every week for the past several years. There’s a reason why I keep going back to it:

The recipe is perfect for bread beginners
Only 6 ingredients required
Most of the time is hands-off
Crisp edges & fluffy interior
So, so flavorful.
It’s the best homemade pizza crust. I always use Red Star Platinum in my pizza dough because I have the best results. The Platinum line is fantastic; its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple.

## Hawaiian Pizza Toppings
Use fresh or canned pineapple chunks. For the ham, you can use either ham or Canadian bacon. The two are similar in taste and texture, but Canadian bacon is a little leaner. And they come from different parts of the pig. (Just in case you were looking for a ham lesson today.) I usually use Canadian bacon. Cooked bacon crumbles are optional, but they add awesome flavor and crunch. You can also add sliced onions too.
